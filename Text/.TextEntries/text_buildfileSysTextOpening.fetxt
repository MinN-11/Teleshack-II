After escaping from Selessian forces,[N]
Loewe and Cleo take the team to regroup.[N]
While the loss of their leader, Dragana,[AN]
leaves them all feeling empty,[N]
they are not without hope.[N]
Cleo and Loewe agree their best choice[AN]
is now to return to Elmhurst Island,[N]
a small enclave off the coast of Decia,[N]
where the liberation army plans activities[AN]
from the relative safety and obscurity[N]
of the sea caves. To get there,[N]
they would need to find a boat.[A][X]
